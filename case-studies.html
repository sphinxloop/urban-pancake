        Everlane’s Q4 signals reinforce its shift into clean luxury: a full Shopify migration,
        deeper sustainability messaging, selective retail activations, and its first-ever
        celebrity ambassador. The brand engine is strengthening through performance-driven
        e-commerce upgrades and culturally relevant partnerships. However, despite surface
        sustainability progress and circularity testing, Everlane’s core operational risk
        remains unchanged. Sourcing is still concentrated in two Vietnam factories, and hiring
        continues to favor creative and paid media roles over supply chain reinforcement.
